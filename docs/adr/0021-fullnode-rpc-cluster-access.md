# ADR 0021 — Account-gated fullnode RPC cluster access

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Relates to:** #6835 (this design), ADR 0020 (self-serve API key issuance
  - storage, #6733), #2111 (archive node), #6646 (tiered/paid public API
    access model, design-spike)

## Context

Two RPC surfaces already exist and are explicitly **out of scope for this
ADR**, kept separate on purpose:

- `GET/POST /rpc/v1/*` — the existing public proxy (`workers/request-handlers/
rpc-proxy.mjs`), a free, keyless, load-balanced-with-failover pool over
  **third-party** community RPC endpoints (`TRUSTED_RPC_UPSTREAM_ORIGINS`:
  `archive.chain.opentensor.ai`, OnFinality, Nodies, the two opentensor.ai
  entrypoints — confirmed live, none of them ours). This stays exactly as-is.
- The dedicated bare-metal **archive node** (#2111, syncing) — owner decision
  (2026-07-19): archive access will be **paid-only, in the future, not now**.
  Not designed here.

This ADR is about a **third** surface: a **fullnode** RPC cluster (pruned,
recent-state — distinct from the archive node's full historical state),
currently one instance, planned to grow into a real cluster. The owner wants
to offer **account-gated, tiered** access to it — free tier at launch, paid
tiers later — modeled on how taostats offers hosted RPC connectivity.

### Reference model (taostats, researched live 2026-07-19)

- **Sign-up**: `taostats.io/pro/` offers **both** a wallet-based flow (their
  own "Bittensor Auth Gateway" — OAuth2/OIDC-shaped, but the identity is
  chain-backed: the app redirects to taostats Auth, the wallet **signs an
  authentication challenge**, taostats verifies that signature/on-chain
  state, and issues a JWT) **and** simpler email/anonymous sign-in. A free
  API key is available with no payment info; RBAC/billing/paid tiers are
  themselves still listed as "coming soon" on taostats' own docs.
- **RPC delivery**: two WSS endpoints gated by node type — light
  (`wss://api.taostats.io/api/v1/rpc/ws/finney_lite?authorization=API_KEY`)
  and archive (`.../finney_archive?authorization=API_KEY`). The key travels
  as a **query parameter**, not a header — trivially compatible with any
  WebSocket client that can't set custom headers (browsers' native
  `WebSocket`, most Substrate client libraries).

Two design questions this ADR answers:

1. **Auth model** — wallet-signature login, simple email login, or both;
   what's realistic to build first.
2. **Key/tier issuance + the RPC-gating mechanism** — how a validated account
   turns into a usable, rate-differentiated RPC credential, and how the new
   proxy route enforces it.

## Decision

### 1. Reuse ADR 0020's key primitives; this ADR only adds the identity layer

The key **format**, **hashing at rest**, and **validation** ADR 0020 already
designed (`mg_<prefix>_<secret>`, SHA-256 of the secret only,
`timingSafeEqual` compare) apply unchanged here — `src/api-keys.mjs`
(`generateApiKey`, `hashApiKeySecret`, `isValidApiKeySecret`, `parseApiKey`)
is auth-method-agnostic and is reused directly, not reimplemented. What's new
here is **what has to happen before a key can be minted**: instead of ADR
0020's "email contact + rate limit" anti-abuse gate on an otherwise-anonymous
mint, this tier requires a **verified account** first.

### 2. Auth: wallet-signature login as the primary path, ship it before email

Given the target audience (agent-reached integration devs already holding a
Bittensor wallet — ADR 0003) and that a wallet challenge-sign is the more
native fit than adding a third-party OAuth provider dependency, **wallet
login ships first**:

- **Challenge issuance**: `POST /api/v1/auth/wallet/challenge { ss58 }` →
  a short-lived, single-use nonce (e.g. `mg-login:<ss58>:<random>`, stored in
  KV with a short TTL — mirrors the negative-cache-style short-TTL pattern
  already used elsewhere, e.g. `SUDO_KEY_NEGATIVE_KV_TTL`).
- **Verification**: `POST /api/v1/auth/wallet/verify { ss58, signature }` —
  the caller signs the issued challenge with their coldkey/hotkey (client-
  side, via `@polkadot/extension-dapp` or the wallet's own signer — the
  signing key material is never transmitted to or handled by this codebase
  at all), the Worker verifies the signature against the claimed `ss58`,
  consumes the nonce (single-use), and on success issues a session tied to
  that account.
- **Open technical question, not resolved here**: Bittensor wallets are
  predominantly **sr25519** (Schnorrkel), which `@noble/curves` does not
  implement, and the reference implementation
  (`@polkadot/util-crypto`/`@polkadot/wasm-crypto`) is a WASM build whose
  Cloudflare Workers compatibility is **unverified** — this codebase already
  had to reject `node:crypto`'s `blake2b512` for exactly this class of
  workerd-compatibility surprise (`src/account-balance.mjs`'s header). Some
  Bittensor tooling supports ed25519 keys too, which `@noble/curves/ed25519`
  (already an indirect dependency via `@noble/hashes`' sibling package) DOES
  cover. Before writing a single line of verification code: prototype
  sr25519 signature verification in an actual `wrangler dev`/Miniflare
  environment and confirm it works, or scope v1 to ed25519-only wallets with
  sr25519 as an explicit, flagged follow-up. **Do not guess this — verify it
  first**, the same discipline this codebase already applies to every other
  crypto primitive choice.
- **Email/anonymous sign-in** (taostats' simpler fallback path) is
  explicitly **deferred**, not rejected — v1 ships wallet-only to keep the
  identity model to one path while it's new; revisit once wallet login is
  live and real usage data exists.

### 3. Session + account storage: Postgres row (same tier as ADR 0020's `api_keys`)

A new `rpc_accounts` table (`ss58 UNIQUE`, `tier`, `created_at`), reached the
same way `api_keys`/`chain_alert_triggers` are — through
`workers/data-api.mjs`'s Hyperdrive connection, never D1 (fully retired).
One account can hold multiple API keys (`api_keys.account_id` becomes a
nullable foreign key — nullable because ADR 0020's own anonymous, contact-
only keys keep working unchanged for the public API tier this ADR doesn't
touch). A session (post wallet-verify) is a short-lived signed cookie or
bearer token scoped only to the key-management UI/routes (creating/listing/
revoking THIS account's own keys) — the actual RPC credential is still the
`mg_...` API key, not the session, matching taostats' own "session gets you
to the dashboard, the API key is the actual bearer credential" split.

### 4. Tiering: one free tier at launch, matching taostats' own current reality

Even taostats' own RBAC/billing is "coming soon" per their docs — there is no
working reference implementation to copy for paid tiers yet, so this ADR
doesn't invent one. v1 ships a single `tier: "free"` on every `rpc_accounts`
row (the column exists so a later paid tier is additive, not a schema
migration). A rate limit distinct from (and looser than, this being the
actual product) the existing anonymous `/rpc/v1` pool's limits applies per
key, enforced the same Cloudflare Workers Rate Limiting binding pattern ADR
0020 already establishes.

### 5. New route, new infra, explicitly isolated from the public pool

- **`/rpc/v1/fullnode/*`** (exact path TBD in implementation, naming should
  make "this is the gated one" obvious) proxies **only** to the fullnode
  cluster — no failover into `TRUSTED_RPC_UPSTREAM_ORIGINS`'s public pool,
  and vice versa. Mixing a best-effort public failover path with a paid/
  gated guaranteed path in the same failover logic is a real isolation risk:
  a public-pool degradation must never affect a paying caller's request, and
  a gated-tier incident must never silently fail open to public traffic.
- **Network exposure**: the fullnode(s) need a Cloudflare Tunnel hostname the
  Worker can reach, the same mechanism already used for the archive box's
  Postgres connection via Hyperdrive (`wrangler.data.jsonc`'s own comment:
  "self-hosted indexer box Postgres, reached via Cloudflare Tunnel"). This is
  an infra-side action (metagraphed-infra/Ansible), not application code —
  tracked as a prerequisite, not designed here.
- **Key delivery matches taostats' own convention** (`?authorization=`
  query param, not a header) specifically so existing WSS client code
  written against taostats-shaped URLs needs minimal changes to point at
  this instead — a deliberate compatibility choice, not an accidental
  departure from ADR 0020's header-based convention for the public API.

## Consequences

- This is the **first user-account system** in this codebase (ADR 0020
  explicitly noted there was none). `rpc_accounts` + wallet-signature
  verification is new surface area, not an extension of an existing pattern.
- The sr25519-in-workerd question **blocks real implementation** until
  answered — this ADR's wallet-login design is sound independent of that
  answer, but the answer determines whether v1 ships sr25519, ed25519-only,
  or a client-side-verification-service workaround.
- The archive node and the existing public `/rpc/v1` proxy are unaffected —
  zero risk of this work regressing either.
- `src/api-keys.mjs` (format/hash/validate) is now used by two independent
  systems (ADR 0020's anonymous public-API keys and this ADR's account-
  linked fullnode keys) — any change to that module needs both call sites
  considered.

## Open questions

- **sr25519 verification library/runtime feasibility** — see section 2.
  Needs a real `wrangler dev` prototype before implementation starts, not a
  design-time guess.
- **Fullnode cluster load-balancing**: with only one instance today, the
  "cluster" framing is aspirational — does the new route need real multi-
  instance failover logic now, or a single-origin proxy that's refactored
  into a pool once a second instance actually exists? Leaning toward the
  latter (build for the class the moment it's real, not speculatively).
- **Paid tiers**: explicitly deferred to #6646 (needs the owner's pricing/
  billing-provider call) — this ADR only reserves the `tier` column.
- **Email/anonymous login**: deferred, not designed — revisit once wallet
  login has real usage.
- **Session mechanism**: signed cookie vs. bearer token for the key-
  management dashboard/routes isn't decided — whichever is simpler to
  implement correctly without a framework this codebase doesn't have wins;
  needs a concrete choice before implementation, not during it.
